Welcome to *Java, the Carlos Way!* Over the course of this series, I'm going to try to teach you Java in the easiest way possible. There's a lot of content, so be sure to take things slowly and at your own pace. I'll do my best to link to a lot of different tutorials for more in-depth review. Now that I've got your attention, let's get started!

## Why This Exists
When I was 12 years old, I decided to tackle my first programming language, Python. I did so without any prior knowledge, without any formal textbooks or teachers: completely on my own. In the same way that I was able to learn from volunteers for free and on blogs and YouTube sites from people around the world, so too I want to impart my knowledge. I hope you are able to learn a great deal from this, and if you do, please consider passing on what you learn as a programmer. Soon, we will make the world full of people who know programming!

Now, let's get started...

# Java 101 (The Boring Stuff)

***

I call this "The Boring Stuff" because I know you want to get dirty with code! However, there are some central things you must understand before jumping into a development environment and writing code...

## What Is OOP?
**OOP**, or [Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), is a method of programming in which a programmer writes **classes**, and **functions** for those classes, and develops a hierarchical structure in order to achieve his or her programming goals. There are many different programming languages: Python, Java, C++, and more, and each has their own separate use case. Java is primarily used for developing **cross-platform** applications, or programs that can run on more than one system, such as Android, Windows, Mac, and iOS.

### The Java Hierarchy
In Java, as well as in other programming languages, there is a general hierarchy that dictates the way we use the language.

I have created a handy diagram in order to illustrate the Java Hierarchy:
![The Java Hierarchy.](/assets/images/TheJavaHierarchy.png)

#### Levels of Hierarchy
The levels of hierarchy go as follows:
1. Packages
    - A package is the highest level that can be imported into a Java program. Some of the most popular Java packages are:
      - `Java.util`
      - `Java.lang`
    - Every class in Java is contained into packages.
    - It is possible to create your own class when designing a project, but this is only recommended when it is a very big project and requires developing entire classes from scratch.
    - Class names are denoted by a lowercase letter.
2. Classes
    - Classes are contained with in packages, and are usually the most often written by programmers when designing a program.
    - Some popular Java classes are:
      -`Java.lang.Math`
      -`Java.util.Random`
    - Class names should begin with a capital letter.
3. Objects
    - Objects are what we call *instances* of a class, in which one *instantiates* a class in order to use it in our program. Instantiating is like "materializing" it, and allows us to use its member functions/variables.
4. Code (Functions and Variables)
    - Inside of every class lie functions and variables that are relevant to its name. Though there may be many *instances* of a single class, it is these member functions and variables that separate them from each other.
    - Member functions use *camelCase*, which will be explained later.

#### The Java API
[The Java API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html) is the number one website you'll be referencing and bookmarking throughout your studies. It contains the list of all of the packages, classes, objects, and methods that are embedded into the base version of Java that is shipped onto millions of devices. Few languages have as good a documentation as Java, which is why it's a favorite for many programmers.

### Syntax
What distinguishes Java from any other language its *syntax*. Just like any written language, programming languages each have their own set of syntax, and to learn the syntax by heart and to be able to use it seamlessly is truly to **know** the programming language. There are two categories to programming syntax:

1. Syntax that the language interprets
    - This has to be exact, or else the computer will not know what telling it to do.
2. Syntax that is used by programmers to make it readable to other programmers.
    - This is not technically necessary, but a good programmer will always use common programming conventions.
