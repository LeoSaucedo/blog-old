Welcome! my name is Carlos, and I'm an avid Computer Science Student with concentrations in Math, Physics, and Economics.

## Background
I have been extremely passionate about programming ever since discovering it when I was 12 years old, and have since then not stopped to strive to learn the newest technologies and frameworks.

Currently, my areas of most interest include Artificial Intelligence, Chatbots, and Cross-Platform applications.

I also love teaching what I know to everyone I can, which is one of the primary reasons this blog exists!

Thanks for the visit, and I hope you find my posts entertaining!
